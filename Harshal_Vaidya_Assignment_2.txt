Q1. For each customer, product, month and state combination, compute (1) the
customer's average sale of this product for the given month and state, (2) the
customer’s average sale for the given month and state, but for all other products 
(3)the customer’s average sale for the given product and state, but for all other months
and (4) the average sale of the product and the month but for all other states.


Query 1:
with t1 as
(
	select cust, prod, month, state, avg(quant) as cust_avg 
	from sales 
	group by cust, prod, month, state
),
t2 as
(
	select t1.cust, t1.prod, t1.month, t1.state, t1.cust_avg, avg(s.quant) as other_prod_avg 
	from t1, sales as s 
	where t1.cust = s.cust 
	and t1.state = s.state 
	and t1.month = s.month
	and t1.prod != s.prod 
	group by t1.cust, t1.prod, t1.month, t1.state, t1.cust_avg

order by t1.cust,t1.prod, t1.month, t1.state

Q2. For customer, product and state, show the average sales before and after each
quarter (e.g., for Q2, show average sales of Q1 and Q3. For “before” Q1 and “after” Q4,
display <NULL>. The “YEAR” attribute is not considered for this query – for
example, both Q1 of 2017 and Q1 of 2018 are considered Q1 regardless of the year.

Query 2:
with allData as
(
	select cust, prod, state 
	from sales 
	group by cust, prod, state
),
q1 as
(
	select cust, prod, state, avg(quant) as quant 
	from sales 
	where month between 1 and 3 
	group by cust, prod, state
), 
q2 as 
(
	select cust, prod, state, avg(quant) as quant 
	from sales where month between 4 and 6 
	group by cust, prod, state
),
q3 as 
(
	select cust, prod, state, avg(quant) as quant 
	from sales 
	where month between 7 and 9 
	group by cust, prod, state
), 
q4 as 
(
	select cust, prod, state, avg(quant) as quant 
	from sales 
	where month between 10 and 12 
	group by cust, prod, state
),

	select D.cust as CUSTOMER, D.prod as PRODUCT, D.state, 1 as q1, cast(null as numeric) as BEFORE_AVG, q2.quant as AFTER_AVG 
	from allData as D,q2 
	where D.cust = q2.cust
	and D.prod = q2.prod
	and D.state = q2.state
),

	select D.cust as CUSTOMER, D.prod as PRODUCT, D.state, 2 as q1, q1.quant as BEFORE_AVG, q3.quant as AFTER_AVG

	where D.cust = q1.cust
	and D.cust = q3.cust
	and D.prod = q1.prod
	and D.prod = q3.prod
	and D.state = q1.state
	and D.state = q3.state

),

	and D.state = q2.state
	and D.state = q4.state

	select D.cust as CUSTOMER, D.prod as PRODUCT, D.state, 4 as q1, q3.quant as BEFORE_AVG, cast(null as numeric) as AFTER_AVG 
	from allData as D, q3
	where D.cust = q3.cust
	and D.prod = q3.prod
	and D.state = q3.state
),
t5 as
(
	select * from t1 
	union 
	select * from t2 
	union 
	select * from t3 
	union 
	select * from t4
)
select * from t5 order by CUSTOMER, PRODUCT, state, q1

Q3. For each product, find the median sales quantity (assume an odd number of sales for
simplicity of presentation). (NOTE – “median” is defined as “denoting or relating to a
value or quantity lying at the midpoint of a frequency distribution of observed values or
quantities, such that there is an equal probability of falling above or below it.” E.g.,
Median value of the list {13, 23, 12, 16, 15, 9, 29} is 15

Query 3:
with t1 as
(
	select s.prod, s.quant, (select count(*) 
							 from sales 
							 where s.quant >= quant 
							 and s.prod = prod) as count 
	from sales s
	order by s.prod, count
),
t2 as
(
	select t1.prod, count(t1.prod)/2 + 1 as half_count
	from t1 
	group by t1.prod
	order by t1.prod
),
t3 as
(
	select t1.prod, t1.quant 
	from t1, t2 
	where t1.prod = t2.prod 
	and t2.half_count <= t1.count 
	order by t1.prod, t1.quant
)
select t3.prod as product, min(t3.quant) as median_quant 
from t3 
group by t3.prod

Q4. For customer and product, find the month by which time, 75% of the sales quantities
have been purchased. Again, for this query, the “YEAR” attribute is not considered.
Another way to view this query is to pretend all 10,000 rows of sales data are from the
same year.

Query 4:
with t1 as 
(
	select cust, prod, month, sum(quant) 
	from sales 
	group by cust, prod, month 
	order by cust, prod, month
),
t2 as 
(
	select cust, prod, sum(sum) 
	from t1 
	group by cust, prod
),
t3 as 
(	select a.cust, a.prod, a.month, a.sum, sum(b.sum) as continous_sum 
	from t1 as a, t1 as b 
	where b.month <= a.month 
	and a.cust = b.cust 
	and a.prod = b.prod 
	group by a.cust, a.prod, a.month, a.sum 
	order by cust, prod, month
), 
t4 as 
(
	select a.cust, a.prod, a.month 
	from t3 as a, t2 as b 
	where a.cust = b.cust 
	and a.prod = b.prod 
	and a.continous_sum >= (0.75 * b.sum) 
	order by cust, prod, month
)
select cust as CUSTOMER, 
	   prod as PRODUCT, 
	   min(month) as "75% purchased by month" 
from t4 
group by cust, prod
order by cust, prod
